Things to do:
 [ ] Have a "browser focused" mode where the action is sent to Firebase to keep the "tick" going. (player_active: bool)
 [x] Move event stream to custom styling @done (15-06-29 19:06)
   [ ] Add 1s animation for new events
 [ ] Create building design
 [ ] Wireframe expand and explore tab
 [x] Create basic firebase example to start basing data off and affecting changes @done (15-07-08 12:58)
 [x] Design dynamic map/building placement @done (15-07-08 12:58)
 [ ] Think of data structure for event graphs
 [ ] Design event "investigate" panel
 [ ] Design assign unit panel
 [x] Authentication @done (15-06-28 15:55)
 [x] Research js object diffing for policy changes @done (15-07-08 12:58)
 [ ] Add design for tab notifications
 [ ] Progress bars for buildings, land prepping, unit level, teaching progress,
 [ ] Starting storyline
   [ ] Escaped evil tribe
   [ ] x2 building slots
   [ ] 3 resources to start: Timber, Meals, Glowstones. Teach the player how to juggle these and how to make tradeoffs. Add stone to add new spearmen.
   [ ] x1 scout (jupiter), x1 builder, x1 spearman, x1 villager (takes 2 bunnies to learn a trade)
     [ ] Scouts: Explore for more land (potential building space), find villagers, random encounters with wildlife, uncommonly find basic blueprints, find cattered resources.
     [ ] Builder: Completes building projects.
     [ ] Villagers: Harvest rice, cut trees for timber, harvest basic resources.
   [ ] Over the course of a bunny, add 2 new villagers and one drunk.
   [ ] After 1 tiger, "begginers charm" has faded. The only way to attract new villagers is to be proactive about it.
   [ ] After 1 bunny, another nearby village bumps into another village.

NOTES

Logs vs Actionable Events vs Storylines ?
Groups of people work together to do things. Should there be "UnitParties" ?
"Overtime working" gets things done at x1.5 speed, but minus 1%/morrow/on-duty unit.
Survival based - Can you build a village that survives longer than {x time frame}?
